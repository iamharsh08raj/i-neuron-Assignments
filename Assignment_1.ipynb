What is the difference between string and variable?\nA variable is where we store values and a string is a type of value stored in a variable.\nEg: x=’Harsh’\nHere x is a variable and ‘Harsh’ is a string.\n\n3. Describe three different data types.\nInteger- Integer is a data type which stores whole numbers.\nEg- 1,2,3,etc.\nString- String is a data type that stores sequence of characters.\nEg- “Harsh”\nBoolean- String is a data type that stores two values True & False.\n\n\n",

An expression is evaluated as per the precedence of its operators.\n\n5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\nAn expression is a combination of values and functions that are combined and interpreted by the compiler to create a new value, A statement which is just a standalone unit of execution and doesn't return anything.\n\n6.
